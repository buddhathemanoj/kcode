Analyze the codebase structure and create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file that includes:
1. Project overview - what the project does
2. Tech stack and dependencies
3. Key commands (build, test, run, lint)
4. Architecture overview with folder structure
5. Important files and their purposes
6. Code conventions and patterns used
7. Any environment setup requirements

Make the CLAUDE.md concise but informative, focusing on what an AI assistant needs to know to work effectively with this codebase.`,

Please help me create a memory/note about this project that captures:
- Key decisions made
- Important context
- Patterns or conventions to follow
- Any gotchas or things to remember

Ask me what specific information I'd like to remember, then format it clearly for future reference.`,
  think: `I need you to think deeply about this problem before responding.

Take your time to:
1. Understand the full context and requirements
2. Consider multiple approaches and their trade-offs
3. Identify potential edge cases and issues
4. Form a comprehensive plan before taking action

Please think step by step and explain your reasoning thoroughly.`,
  "worktree-setup": `Create a worktree setup script for this project.

Your task:
1. Analyze the project to understand what's needed to set up a working copy
2. Create the file .anchor/worktree.json with setup commands

The goal is to reproduce the EXACT same working state as the original repo in the new worktree.

Rules:
- Use only "setup-worktree" key (works on all platforms)
- Install dependencies using the project's package manager (check for bun.lockb, pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, package-lock.json)
- Copy ALL real env files that exist (.env, .env.local, .env.development, etc) - NOT example files
- Use $ROOT_WORKTREE_PATH to reference the main repo path
- Don't include build steps unless absolutely necessary for the project to work

Example output for .anchor/worktree.json:
{
  "setup-worktree": [
    "bun install",
    "cp $ROOT_WORKTREE_PATH/.env .env",
    "cp $ROOT_WORKTREE_PATH/.env.local .env.local"
  ]
}

Now analyze this project and create .anchor/worktree.json with the appropriate setup commands.`,
